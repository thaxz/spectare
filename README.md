# spectare

Spectare is an app that helps to browse movies and stay informed.

Contains a search engine that allows you to see advanced details of a movie, besides, there's a lot of lists, such as upcoming, most popular, top daily and weekly movies.

Spectare is my first attempt to use an API. I've used it to learn how to use tasks, make requests and extract information from web.
